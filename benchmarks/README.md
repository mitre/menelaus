# Menelaus Detectors & Baselines

##  Overview

This file houses benchmarking results for a variety of algorithms available under `menelaus`, to establish baselines for detector efficacy and efficiency. 

*TODO*
- add more details

## Runtimes

*TODO*
- determine if/how detecting power of each algorithm can be put in a table
- plot over increasing data size may be needed
- tables may eventually need to be generated through HTML

### On what data?

| Detector | Category  | Runtime (total s) | Runtime (s/update) |
| -------- | --------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| KdqTree  | batch     | 5 million         | 42                 |
| KdqTree  | streaming | 5 million         | 2                  |
