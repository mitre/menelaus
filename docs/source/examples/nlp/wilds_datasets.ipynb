    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates an experimental NLP-based drift detection algorithm. It uses the \"Civil Comments\" dataset ([link](https://github.com/p-lambda/wilds/blob/main/wilds/datasets/civilcomments_dataset.py) to a Python loading script with additional details/links) from the `wilds` library, which contains online comments meant to be used in toxicity classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example and the experimental modules often pull directly and indirectly from [`alibi-detect`](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi-detect/tree/master) and its own [example(s)](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/alibi-detect/en/stable/examples/cd_text_imdb.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is experimental, and has notable issues:\n",
    "- transform functions are very slow, on even moderate batch sizes\n",
    "- detector design is not generalized, and may not work on streaming problems, or with data representations of different types/shapes\n",
    "- some warnings below are not addressed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "Code (transforms, alarm, detector) is pulled from the experimental module in `menelaus`, which is live but not fully tested. Note that commented code shows `wilds` modules being used to access and save the dataset to disk, but are excluded to save time. The example hence assumes the dataset is locally available."
