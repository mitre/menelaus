Menelaus implements algorithms for the purposes of drift detection. Drift
detection is a branch of machine learning focused on the detection of unforeseen
shifts in data. The relationships between variables in a dataset are rarely
static and can be affected by changes in both internal and external factors,
e.g. changes in data collection techniques, external protocols, and/or
population demographics. Both undetected changes in data and undetected model
underperformance pose risks to the users thereof. The aim of this package is to
enable monitoring of data and machine learning model performance.
